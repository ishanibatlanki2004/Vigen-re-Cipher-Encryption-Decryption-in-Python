# Vigenere-Cipher-Encryption-Decryption-in-Python
This repository contains a simple yet effective Python implementation of the Vigen√®re cipher, a classical encryption method that utilizes keyword-based shifting to encode and decode text. This cipher provides a layer of security beyond simple Caesar ciphers by integrating a customizable key to dynamically alter letter shifts throughout the message.
FEATURES:
1.Custom Key-Based Encryption: Encrypt and decrypt text using any user-defined key.
2.Automatic Handling of Non-Alphabet Characters: Special characters, spaces, and numbers remain untouched in both encryption and decryption processes.
3.Modular Design: Functions are structured efficiently, making it easy to expand the implementation or integrate it into larger projects. 
4.Bi-Directional Cipher: Allows encoding and decoding via simple function calls, maintaining reversible transformations with the same key. 
5.Lightweight & Readable Code: Clean Python implementation that emphasizes clarity and ease of use.
