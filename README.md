Vigenère Cipher Encryption & Decryption in Python
This repository contains a simple yet effective Python implementation of the Vigenère cipher, a classical encryption method that utilizes keyword-based shifting to encode and decode text. This cipher provides a layer of security beyond simple Caesar ciphers by integrating a customizable key to dynamically alter letter shifts throughout the message.
Features:
1.Encrypt and decrypt text using the Vigenère cipher.
2.Handles non-alphabet characters without modification.
3.Implements a modular and reusable function for encryption and decryption.
4.Written in clean, readable Python code.
Usage:
1.Set the message to be encrypted.
2.Choose a custom key for encryption.
3.Run the script to generate the encrypted text.
4.Decrypt the text using the same key.
